Sharplike
=========

Sharplike is a roguelike library for C# that runs on .NET and Mono (not on
MonoTouch). It provides graphics, audio, input, and state control abstractions
implemented for Windows, OS X, and Linux with OpenTK.

This project is no longer supported, but if anyone wants to pick it up and run
with it we'd be happy to help.
